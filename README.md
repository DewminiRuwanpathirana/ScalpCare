# ScalpCare
This web application is able to find the type of hair/scalp disease that the patient suffers from and provide possible self-treatment methods for the disease to save the patient's time and money. If the user wants to contact a dermatologist, the application recommends a list of dermatologists from known hospitals across Sri Lanka where patients can choose their preferred dermatologist.
